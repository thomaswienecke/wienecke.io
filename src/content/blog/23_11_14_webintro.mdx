As part of this year's introductory talks of the [KITCTF](https://kitctf.de/) team, I gave a talk about hacking web applications. 
You can find the slides [here](https://kitctf.de/talks/2023-11-02-webintro/slides.pdf).

The talk was an introduction to the topic and covered the basics of web security and how to approach CTF challenges in the web category. 
It also covered some of the most common vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.
