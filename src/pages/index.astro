		My name is Thomas and I'm passionate about computer science, especially cybersecurity, devops and homelabs. 
		In addition I enjoy cooking vegan food ðŸ¥˜.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) 
		while working as a student at abusix where I am involved in building a network security platform.

		During my free time, I work on my homelab or engage in CTFs. 
		If you are interested in cybersecurity, I recommend checking out <a href="https://kitctf.de" target="_blank">KITCTF</a>,
